Geo2Data Workshop - Visualizing Data in Python â€“ Oil and Gas Applications

This dashboard uses well logs from 1 well in the Williston Basin, the idea is to use the data for the following physical properties 'GR','RHOZ','NPHI' in order to generates cluster of data 
with similar characteristics, then by applying different unsupersvised clustering algorithms we can establish relationships such that each cluster represents a rock type.
